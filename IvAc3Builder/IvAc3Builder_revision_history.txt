IvAc3 Builder Revision history
==============================

Version 0.99 (3-November-2019)
------------------------------
Added: Runway thresholds coordinates in searchable database (Note search has to be performed by airport ICAO Id, then RWY thresholds will be displayed)
Added: Procedure turn calculation matching a defined end point
Changed: Procedure turn module display and options
[NOTE: Next version will be 1.00]

Version 0.98 (1-November-2019) 
------------------------------
Fix: Discard LineStrings and LineRings without any coordinates in Google Earth export
Added: Google Earth single point extraction (ONLY AVAILABLE if OTHER export section destination is selected)
Added: Placemark name optionally used as prefix (Other export section destination)
Changed: Runway marks builder module: addition of FCL export as polygons with custom RGB fill/background/border colors and some other minor changes  
Changed: Shapes builder module: addition of FCL export as polygons with custom RGB fill/background/border colors 

Version 0.97 (31-October-2019)
------------------------------
Fix: Errors in GSHHG.dat file extraction for some files 

Version 0.96 (27-October-2019)
------------------------------
Fix: AIRAC airway extraction when same airway goes out then in again in a selected area (requires a track label change)
Fix: AIRAC airway label concordance between low/high airways that share some paths
Changed: Google Earth extraction so as to better fit the retrieved data (line string or polygon) with IvAc3 organization (GEO, FCL or other section)

Version 0.95 (21-October-2019)
------------------------------
Fix: Runtime error in some modules due to incorrect label reference
Changed: Airway extraction (grouped labels for airways with same segments for avoiding superimposition)

Version 0.94 (20-October-2019)
------------------------------
Changed: Removed empty color warning that is quite useless (considering it only applies to GEO section and
recalculation with a different color can be done immediately)
Added: Tolerance % for arc calculation from start/end point

Version 0.93 (18-October-2019)
------------------------------
Changed: Google Earth export and some other module outputs can now be formatted as dual lat/lng (applicable to GEO section only)
or single lat/lng (applicable to other sections)
Changed: Color attribute only applicable to outputs for GEO sections (that is when a double lat/lng is selected)
Fix: Small bugs in Google Earth export
Changed: several other minor changes 

Version 0.92 (17-October-2019)
------------------------------
Fix and Changed: IvAc1 runway extraction (Airport ID and options)
Fix: IvAc1 ARTCC/AIRWAYS/SID/STAR extraction (single coordinate instead of dual)

Changed: Program and database update routines and procedures

Changed: several other minor changes 
[Still Todo list: airway label overlap for segments common to several airways]  

Version 0.82 (9-October-2019)
-----------------------------
Fix: Several color settings missing or incorrectly set in some modules
Fix: Several end of lines (semicolon + carriage return) not correctly added in some procedures
